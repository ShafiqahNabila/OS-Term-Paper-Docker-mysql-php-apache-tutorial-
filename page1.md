### _Introduction to Docker_
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables user to separate the applications from their infrastructure so they can deliver the software quickly. With Docker, user can manage the infrastructure in the same ways that they can manage their applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, user can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

### _What Docker is used for?_
1. _Fast, consistent delivery of applications_
    * Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.
    
2. _Responsive deployment and scaling_
    * Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.
    * Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time.
    
3. _Running more workloads on the same hardware_
    * Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so user can use more or their compute capacity to achieve their business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where user need to do more fewer resources.
